# composable-react

Open the folder of the component that you want to test, for example, ```checkbox```. Go inside the ```src``` folder and copy following files:
  1. ```App.css```
  2. ```App.jsx```

Now go to ```main``` folder and paste them inside ```src``` folder. Run the main app using ```npm run dev``` and see the component on UI

Happy Composing!
